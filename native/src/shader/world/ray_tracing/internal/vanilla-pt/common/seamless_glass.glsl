// Seamless glass: vanilla glass textures draw a frame around every block, so a wall of glass reads as a grid of
// separate blocks. With this on, a point of a glass face within the frame's width of its block's edge takes its
// colour from just inside the frame instead, and neighbouring blocks of the same glass join into one sheet.
//
// Worked out from where the point lies in its block, not from the texture: a pane's front shows only a strip of
// its texture, and the frame lies on the block's edges whichever part of the texture a face shows.
