# Lighting

![Radiante settings: Lighting](../../images/ui/settings-lighting.png)

| Control | Range | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Day Brightness** | 0% – 400% | 25% | Sun and sky light by day. |
| **Night Brightness** | 0% – 400% | 35% | Moon and sky light by night. |
| **Light Source Brightness** | 0% – 400% | 12% | Blocks that give off light: torches, lava, glowstone… |
| **Held Light Brightness** | 0% – 400% | 12% | What you hold: its own glow and the light it casts. Needs Held Item Light. |
| **Bounced Light** | 50% – 200% | 150% | How much light carries on after a bounce. 100% is physically correct; higher fills rooms like Bedrock RTX. |
| **Sky Light** | 50% – 400% | 180% | How much the open sky lights the world. |
| **Block Light Sampling** | On / Off | On | Each surface casts a shadow ray straight at a nearby light. Much less noise at night and in caves. Needs Block Emission (in [Performance](performance.md)). |
| **ReSTIR Block Lights** | On / Off | On | Reuses the light each pixel picked across frames and neighbours. Much less noise in rooms with many lights. Needs Block Light Sampling. |
| **Shader Execution Reordering** | On / Off | Off | SER: the GPU groups similar rays. Meant for RTX 40 or newer. Experimental: water may look white. |
| **Held Item Light** | On / Off | On | A torch or lantern in either hand lights its surroundings. |
| **First Person Shadow** | On / Off | On | Draws the player for shadows and reflections in first person. |

## Bounced Light and Sky Light are part of the Picture Style too

They change with the Picture Style (see [Image](image.md) and
[styles-and-quality.md](../styles-and-quality.md)). Changing them by hand turns the style into
Custom.
